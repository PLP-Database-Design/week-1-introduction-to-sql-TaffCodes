## Answers to Assignment
### 1. State and Explain the components of a DBMS(Database Management System)
A DBMS contains the following;
  - Database Engine: Handles data storage, retrieval, and updates, providing a mechanism for interacting with the database.
  - Data Definition Language (DDL): Defines the schema, creating and modifying database structure (tables, indexes, etc.).
  - Data Manipulation Language (DML): Allows for querying and modifying data (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
  - Query Processor: Interprets and executes database queries written in SQL or other languages.
  - Transaction Manager: Ensures data integrity and handles transactions with ACID properties.
  - Metadata Catalog: Stores schema definitions and other metadata about the database.
  - User Interface: Provides tools or interfaces for database administrators and users to interact with the DBMS.
### 2. What is a relational database? Give 4 examples.
A relational database organizes data into tables (rows and columns) with relationships between them based on shared attributes.

Examples include; MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database and Microsoft SQL Server.
### 3. State and Explain three classifications of SQL?
- Data Definition Language (DDL): Commands for defining and managing database structures.
  Examples: CREATE, ALTER, DROP.

- Data Manipulation Language (DML): Commands for interacting with data.
  Examples: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

- Data Control Language (DCL): Commands for managing access permissions.
  Examples: GRANT, REVOKE.
### 4. What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?
A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table while a foreign key is a field in one table that establishes a relationship with a primary key in another table to enforce referential integrity.
### 5. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?
An ERD is a graphical representation of entities, their attributes, and relationships in a database. It helps visualize the structure and design of the database.
### 6. What are the advantages of relational databases?
1. Data Integrity: Maintains accurate and consistent data through constraints.
2. Flexibility: Easy to update and modify data without major changes to structure.
3. Data Relationships: Efficiently handles complex relationships using joins.
4. Scalability: Handles large datasets and can be scaled as needed.

### 7. State four types of data type used to store data in tables?
- Integer: For storing whole numbers (e.g., INT).
- String: For textual data (e.g., VARCHAR, TEXT).
- Date/Time: For date and time values (e.g., DATE, TIMESTAMP).
- Decimal: For precise numeric values (e.g., DECIMAL, FLOAT).

### 8. What is the purpose of a database management system (DBMS)?
A DBMS enables efficient data storage, retrieval, and management by providing tools and functionalities to organize, secure, and manipulate data in a systematic manner.
